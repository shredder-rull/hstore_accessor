# HstoreAccessor

PostgreSQL provides an hstore data type for storing arbitrarily complex
structures in a column.  ActiveRecord 4.0 supports Hstore but casts all
values in the store to a string.  Further, ActiveRecord does not provide
discrete fields to access values directly in the hstore column.  The
HstoreAccessor gem solves both of these issues.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem "hstore_accessor"

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hstore_accessor

## Usage

### Setup

The `hstore_accessor` method accepts the name of the hstore column you'd
like to use and a hash with keys representing fields and values
indicating the type to be stored in that field.  The available types
are: `string`, `integer`, `float`, `time`, `boolean`, `array`, and `hash`.

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  hstore_accessor :options,
    color: :string,
    weight: :integer,
    price: :float,
    built_at: :time,
    tags: :array,
    ratings: :hash
end
```

Now you can interact with the fields stored in the hstore directly.

```ruby
p = Product.new
p.color = "green"
p.weight = 34
p.price = 99.95
p.built_at = Time.now - 10.days
p.popular = true
p.tags = %w(housewares kitchen)
p.ratings = { user_a: 3, user_b: 4 }
```

Reading these fields works as well.

```ruby
p.color # => "green"
p.tags  # => ["housewares", "kitchen"]
```

In order to reduce the storage overhead of hstore keys (especially when
indexed) you can specify an alternate key.

```ruby
hstore_accessor :options,
  color: { data_type: :string, store_key: "c" },
  weight: { data_type: :integer, store_key: "w" }
```

In the above example you can continue to interact with the fields using
their full name but when saved to the database the field will be set
using the `store_key`.

Additionally, dirty tracking is implemented in the same way that normal
`ActiveRecord` fields work.

```ruby
p.color          #=> "green"
p.color = "blue"
p.changed?       #=> true
p.color_changed? #=> true
p.color_was      #=> "green"
p.color_changes  #=> ["green", "blue"]
```

### Scopes

The `hstore_accessor` macro also creates scopes for `string`, `integer`,
`float`, `time`, `boolean`, and `array` fields.

#### String Fields

For `string` types, a `with_<key>` scope is created which checks for
equality.

```ruby
Product.with_color("green")
```

#### Integer and Float Fields

For `integer` and `float` types five scopes are created:

```ruby
Product.price_lt(240.00)  # price less than
Product.price_lte(240.00) # price less than or equal to
Product.price_eq(240.00)  # price equal to
Product.price_gte(240.00) # price greater than or equal to
Product.price_gt(240.00)  # price greater than
```

#### Time Fields

For `time` fileds, three scopes are provided:

```ruby
Product.built_at_before(Time.now)         # built before the given time
Product.built_at_eq(Time.now - 10.days)   # built at an exact time
Product.built_at_after(Time.now - 4.days) # built after the given time
```

#### Array Fields

For `array` types, two scopes are created:

```ruby
Product.tags_eq(%w(housewares kitchen)) # tags equaling
```

#### Boolean Fields

Two scopes are created for `boolean` fields:

```ruby
Product.is_popular  # => when populer is set to true
Product.not_popular # => when populer is set to false
```

Predicate methods are also available on instances:

```ruby
product = Product.new(popular: true)
product.popular? # => true
```

### Single-table Inheritance

One of the big issues with `ActiveRecord` single-table inheritance (STI)
is sparse columns.  Essentially, as sub-types of the original table
diverge further from their parent more columns are left empty in a given
table.  Postgres' `hstore` type provides part of the solution in that
the values in an `hstore` column does not impose a structure - different
rows can have different values.

We set up our table with an hstore field:

```ruby
# db/migration/<timestamp>_create_players_table.rb
class CreateVehiclesTable < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :vehicles do |t|
      t.string :make
      t.string :model
      t.integer :model_year
      t.string :type
      t.hstore :data
    end
  end
end
```

And for our models:

```ruby
# app/models/vehicle.rb
class Vehicle < ActiveRecord::Base
end

# app/models/vehicles/automobile.rb
class Automobile < Vehicle
  hstore_accessor :data,
    axle_count: :integer,
    weight: :float,
    engine_details: :hash
end

# app/models/vehicles/airplane.rb
class Airplane < Vehicle
  hstore_accessor :data,
    engine_type: :string,
    safety_rating: :integer,
    features: :hash
end
```

From here any attributes specific to any sub-class can be stored in the
`hstore` column avoiding sparse data.  Indices can also be created on
individual fields in an `hstore` column.

This approach was originally concieved by Joe Hirn in [this blog
post](http://www.devmynd.com/blog/2013-3-single-table-inheritance-hstore-lovely-combination).

## Changelog

`1.0.0` - Changed the way that hashes and arrays are serialized into the
Hstore column. We are using YAML now. This allows for more complex
data structures within those types. It also allows us to keep Rubyisms like
symbols, integers, hashes, arrays and even custom objects in those Hstore
attributes. In turn, this makes it difficult to query specific array values
in the column's attributes. So, the `_contains` scope has been eliminated.
